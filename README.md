# What's Cookin'? Starter Kit 

What's Cookin was a group project where we designed a complete applicaton including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The interface allows users to click on individual recipe cards, search for recipes, save favorites, and choose recipes to cook.<a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/What%27sCookin-PartOne.html" target="\__blank">project spec</a>.

-   On page load, user is presented with a home page consisting of a search bar on the top left, 4 drop down menus on the top right, and a grid displaying images of all recipes in the database.

-   Above recipe images are options to either favorite (star) or add to "recipes to cook" folder. When favorited, the hollow star is filled in to show it has already been added. Users are unable to duplicate recipes already in favorites folder. Recipes can also be removed from favorites folder.

-   When a recipe card has been clicked on, the user is taken to a new page showing recipe, cost, image, ingredients, and instructions.
